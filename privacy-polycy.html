				</p>
				<h3 class="privacy-policy__heading">
					5. Principles of personal data processing
				</h3>
				<p>
					We process your personal data based on the following principles of fairness and lawfulness:
				</p>
				<h3 class="privacy-policy__heading">
					5.1. Fairness and lawfulness
				</h3>
				<p>
					We process your personal data only after obtaining your consent for the processing and for a determined
					specific purpose unless other specified by law. RiskVille has developed clear procedures regarding the
					processing of personal data based on lawfulness.
				</p>
				<h3 class="privacy-policy__heading">
					5.2. Transparency
				</h3>
				<p>
					We process your personal data in a fair and transparent manner, in respect of your given rights.
				</p>
				<h3 class="privacy-policy__heading">
					5.3. Purpose limitation
				</h3>
				<p>
					We ensure that your personal data is only processed within the purposes outlined in the consent form and
					only by those RiskVille needs to be involved in the processing operations to fulfill these purposes.
					Subsequent changes to the purpose are only possible to a limited extent, and require additional consent
					from you.

					We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than that defined in this
					Policy.
				</p>
				<h3 class="privacy-policy__heading">
					5.4. Data minimization
				</h3>
				<p>
					We gather and process only your personal data if it is actually needed in order to achieve the
					processing purposes. RiskVille also does not retain your personal data longer than it is required to
					achieve the relevant purposes.
				</p>
				<h3 class="privacy-policy__heading">
					5.5. Accuracy
				</h3>
				<p>
					Personal data must be accurate and, if required, kept up-to-date. We take every reasonable step to
					ensure that your data, when inaccurate or incomplete, is either deleted or corrected. We ensure that
					inaccurate or misleading data will be edited as soon as possible.
				</p>
				<h3 class="privacy-policy__heading">
					5.6. Storage limitation
				</h3>
				<p>
					RiskVille is limiting the storage scope and time to a level appropriate to fulfill the purposes of the
					data processing in line with your consent. Therefore, we have specified limited periods for personal
					data storage
				</p>
				<h3 class="privacy-policy__heading">
					5.7. Integrity and confidentiality
				</h3>
				<p>
					We acknowledge personal data to be sensitive. Our priority is to secure the confidentiality and
					integrity of your processed personal data. RiskVille secures your personal data with suitable
					organizational and technical measures to prevent unauthorized access, illegal processing or
					distribution, as well as accidental loss, modification, or destruction.
				</p>
				<h3 class="privacy-policy__heading">
					5.8. Accountability

				</h3>
				<p>
					We are responsible for the compliance with the aforesaid six data protection principles.
				</p>
				<h3 class="privacy-policy__heading">
					6. How we process your personal data
				</h3>
				<p>
					We may process your data by the following ways: collecting, recording, organizing, storing, using,
					structuring, adapting or altering, retrieving, consulting, disclosing by transmission, disseminating or
					otherwise making available, aligning or combining, restricting, and erasing or destructing. We may
					transfer your personal data to our subsidiaries. In this case, they are obliged to provide you with an
					adequate level of personal data protection. We will not transfer personal data of the European Economic
					Area residents out of the European Economic Area without reasonably ensuring that your rights and
					freedoms as a data subject are protected and that you are informed of such transfer. We do not sell or
					pass your personal data to a third party for the purposes of direct marketing.
				</p>
				<h3 class="privacy-policy__heading">
					7. Where we store your personal data
				</h3>
				<p>
					All your personal data, collected by us, is stored within the information technology systems, owned and
					operated by RiskVille, and in the cloud systems. Once we receive your information, we will use all
					reasonable procedures and security measures to avoid unauthorized access, loss, disclosure or amendment
					of the received data.
				</p>
				<h3 class="privacy-policy__heading">
					8. Disclosure of your information
				</h3>
				<p>
					We do not disclose any information about you to any third party without your written consent. However,
					we will have to release specific information about you, if necessary, in relation to the services,
					provided to you, or to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute
					or court order. We will also have to release specific information in special cases, such as if there is
					an attempted breach of the security of the Website, or to report to the legal enforcement officials any
					activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful. While RiskVille maintains the secure Website, you
					should know that computer use may be monitored by third parties, such as network administrators,
					employers, internet providers, operation system and Internet browser vendors, and thus we cannot
					guarantee the security of information you publish online. You disclose all information online at your
					own risk. Please remember that the Website may be hosted outside your home country, and your e-mail
					communications to us may be directed to a server outside your home country. Communications over the
					Internet may not be secure.
